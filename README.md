transmissiond-extension
=======================

This extension enables you to right-click a link
and send it to a Transmission Daemon. 
Note that I have my server behind a firewall
and thus no username/password protection.
Other limitiations includes that it per default
sends the torrent to the hostname "media".
You can either alter the source to a better address
or add "media" to your dns server / hosts file.


How-to
======================
Checkout to a folder.
Open chrome, go to chrome://extensions
Set in programmer mode
Import uncompressed extension
